PLANETS AND MOONS DATASET - AI IN SPACE 
1. DATASET OVERVIEW
The Planets and Moons dataset consists of 8 confirmed planets, 2 dwarf planets, and Earth's Moon — totaling 11 classes. Each class contains approximately 149 optimized 3D photos. The dataset was collected by Emirhan BULUT and licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0, prohibiting commercial use.
2. LIBRARIES AND IMPORTS
Key libraries used include TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. These were used for image processing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
3. DATA PREPARATION
Images were loaded using ImageDataGenerator with rescaling and data augmentation applied. A stratified 5-fold cross-validation split was performed to ensure balanced distribution across folds. Each fold generated training, validation, and test CSV files.
A class distribution plot confirmed that all 11 classes were evenly represented, ensuring balanced training.
4. MODEL DEVELOPMENT
Two convolutional neural network architectures were implemented:
- AlexNet: A sequential CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers. It was compiled with Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
- VGG16: A transfer learning model using pretrained ImageNet weights with additional dense layers on top. Base layers were frozen to leverage learned representations.
5. MODEL TRAINING
Each model was trained for 10 epochs using the training and validation generators derived from the folds. Training progress was monitored through loss and accuracy metrics per epoch.
Summary of training behavior:
- AlexNet showed slow learning and low validation accuracy (~18%).
- VGG16 demonstrated rapid convergence, achieving over 99% validation accuracy.
6. MODEL EVALUATION
Both models were evaluated using the test set. Performance metrics included Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
ALEXNET RESULTS
Accuracy : 0.1799
Precision: 0.0976
Recall   : 0.1799
F1-score : 0.1051

AlexNet suffered from underfitting and failed to generalize, predicting only a few classes correctly.
VGG16 RESULTS
Accuracy : 0.9970
Precision: 0.9971
Recall   : 0.9970
F1-score : 0.9970

VGG16 achieved outstanding performance across all metrics, successfully classifying nearly all test images.
7. MODEL COMPARISON
Final model comparison table:
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
AlexNet	0.1799	0.0976	0.1799	0.1051
VGG16	0.9970	0.9971	0.9970	0.9970
8. CONCLUSION
VGG16 significantly outperformed AlexNet on the Planets and Moons dataset, achieving near-perfect accuracy. Transfer learning proved highly effective for astronomical image classification tasks. Future improvements may include fine-tuning additional layers and testing alternative architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
